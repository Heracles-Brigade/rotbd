Changes made from original RotBD by General BlackDragon:

-All Missions: Set user's/crafts pilot from asuser to bsuser.

BDOG Mission 1:
!!TODO -Camera Sequence ends after opening VO finishes, since we have that now.
-Made 3 american tanks not get deleted with tug/apc, they stay engaged in combat/to defend comm tower.
- Re-Painted terrain to make it match BZ1 better.

BDOG Mission 2:
-Re-Objectify CCA Recycler after NSDF attack is defeated.

BDOG Mission 3:
-Made pilot have 50 sniper ammo instead of adding ammo continously.
-Made Hanger/Supply destructible. Added mission fail if you destroy Hanger before getting intel.
-Made Nav 2 objective succeed if you are inside the tug, or inside another vehicle. If you are a pilot when near Tug, orders you to Commandeer it. When in a vehicle, if you are in the tug, commandeer objective turns green, if your not in tug, doesn't bother displaying commandeer tug.

BDOG Mission 4:
-Moved Nav 1 closer to Mammoth so the trap spawn is more believable. I believe it slid down the hill over time, drifting too far away from Mammoth Decoy.
-Added new Objective for if Mammoth is destroyed.

BDOG Mission 5:
-Made you start out in a BDOG tank instead of an NSDF Tank "player".
-Instead of simply adding Health to the Soviet Comm Tower, upped it's health to 20,000.

BDOG Mission 6:
-Made you start out in a BDOG tank, instead of an NSDF Tank "player"
-Made rescue spawn BDOG pilots instead of NSDF pilots.
-Added a lose condition if any of the pilots die before they get into APCs.
-Made APCs into Tugs, so they can't be used to attack.

BDOG Mission 7:
-Changed Tug to BDOG Tug instead of NSDF Tug.
-Changed path points for spawns on Distress call to utilize an unused path (typo in original code?)
-Added new Objectives for when you lose tug or recy.
-Changed spawn location for one of the distress signal attackers to match the location of distress signal, used the former path for one of the final attackers. I believe this was a typo in original script spawns.

BDOG Mission 8:
-Made you start out in a BDOG tank, instead of an NSDF Tank "player"
-Changed last Objective text to mention rendezvous with Pvt Griggs. (Formerly only mentioned it in mission briefing)
-Added lose condition, if Griggs dies.

BDOG Mission 9:
-Deleted extra 3 NSDF Command buildings (duplicated ontop of eachother.)
-Spread out extra 3 NSDF Fighters. (duplicated ontop of eachother.)
-Added a lose condition if the Armory is destroyed.

BDOG Mission 10:
