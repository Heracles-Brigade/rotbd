Wave 1: This is it, Cobra One. We are finally going back to Earth. We'll be constructing a Launch Pad as soon as the materials are available. The Soviets and Americans do not want us telling anyone back on Earth about this conspiracy, so we can expect them to be heading our way. Fury craft have also been sighted, so expect a lot of heavy combat!

Wave 2: Cobra One, American forces are attacking our scrap silos, you must stop them!

Wave 3: We're building the Launch Pad now, Cobra One, be on your guard.
