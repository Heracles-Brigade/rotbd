Wave 1: Cobra One, we're sending you to steal the Mammoth Tank prototype. Intelligence reports indicate that enemy activity is highest in the center of the volcano. We've dropped a Nav Beacon there.

Wave 2: The readings from that tank don't match our technical data. The tank is a decoy, Cobra One, it's a trap! Get out of there!

Wave 3: Excellent job. We still need you to find and commandeer the real Mammoth Tank. Strange radar readings from the South West, so try searching there.

Wave 4: Excellent work, Cobra One, now get that tank to the Pickup Zone.
