Wave 1: Welcome to Mars, Cobra One, we've disturbing reports about a new soviet super-weapon codenamed "Mammoth". Your first task is to inspect the Hanger at Nav 1. Make sure you aren't detected. You will need to destroy the soviet Radar Tower and Gun Towers around the Hangar before you can inspect it. Your sniper rifle should take them out.

Wave 2: Careful, Cobra One, you are getting too close to that Radar Tower.

Wave 3: According to the Hanger computer, the Supply Depot is located at Nav 2. Go there and steal a tug.

Wave 4: Energy readings indicate that the Mammoth is protected by four Shield Generators. The main control tower for the shield is located at Nav 3. Destroy the Control Tower.

Wave 5: Excellent work, Cobra One. Now go to the Mammoth at Nav 4 and inspect it by moving close to it. Once this has been done, your backpack will transmit the technical data from the Mammoth to us.

Wave 6: Well done, Cobra One. Unfortunately, the transmission from you was detected by the Soviets. Retreat to the pickup zone as quickly as you can. We've got a window of 2 minutes to pick you up.
