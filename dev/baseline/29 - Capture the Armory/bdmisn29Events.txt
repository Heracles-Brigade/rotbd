Events:

On Start:
CameraPath("camera_path", 1000, 1000, Armory); //path_0014
Wave 1, Objective 1, "WHITE".
SetObjectiveName(Nav1, "American Base");

AddHealth(Armory) // IMPROVEMENT: Just set maxHealth to 0.

IMPROVEMENT: Make label_0011 and label_0012 on cliffs into howitzers? Make label_0009 a turret?

if If GetDistance(Player, Armory) < 100 and NOT all NSDF Guards dead,
SetObjectiveOn(all NSDF Guards)
//Note: There is a stack of 4 avfigh in back of base, only 1 is objectified. I believe the other 3 are "extras", somehow got duplicated, can be deleted. The mission only counted the first one.
//Confirmed, there were also 4 NSDF HQCP stacked ontop of each other. Deleted extra 3, opted to keep the extra 3 avfigh to make it tougher, though. Spread them out.

If GetDistance(Player, Armory) < 100 and all NSDF Guards dead, then
