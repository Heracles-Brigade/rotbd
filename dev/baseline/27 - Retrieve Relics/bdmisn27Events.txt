Events:

On Start:
CameraPath("camera_path", 1000, 2000, relic) //path_0006
Wave1 / Objective 1, "WHITE".
SetObjectiveName(Relic1, "Alien Relic");
SetObjectiveOn(Relic1);
SetObjectiveName(Relic2, "Alien Relic");
SetObjectiveOn(Relic2);
SetObjectiveOn(Recycler);
SetObjectiveOn(Tug);
SetObjectiveName(Nav1, "Relic Site");
SetObjectiveName(Nav2, "Relic Site");
SetObjectiveName(Nav3, "Black Dog Outpost");
SetObjectiveName(Nav4, "Navpoint 4");

If GetDistance(Tug, Relic1) or GetDistance(Tug, Relic2) < 50 then
Clear Objectives();
Objective 2, "WHITE".
IMPROVEMENT: Add VO Wave for this event?

When GetDistance(Player, Nav4) < 200, 
spawn: 
2 svrckt "spawn_call1", "spawn_call2", 1 svhraz "spawn_call3", 1 svfigh "spawn_call4" (formerly "spawn_attack4"), //path_0007, path_0008, path_0009, path_000A (formerly path_0010)
//IMPROVEMENT/BUG?: 1 svfigh spawned far away at (path_0010), was this supposed to be path_000A and is a bug? Maybe...
Attack Player.

When all 4 attackers dead,
Objective 2, "GREEN", Objective 3, "WHITE"
Spawn: 
1 svhraz "spawn_defend1_1", 1 svfigh "spawn_defend1_2". //path_000B, path_000C
IMPROVEMENT: Add VO Wave for this event?
IMPROVEMENT: Make them spawn at the relic that was not picked up, instead of Relic1 all the time. Add "spawn_defend2_1"/"spawn_defend2_2" if relic 1 is picked up first, else spawn_defend1 is used.

if GetTug(relic1/2) and GetDistance(Tug, Nav3) < 200 then
ClearObjectives();
Objective 4, "WHITE"
IMPROVEMENT: Make it distance from Recy? maybe...

When tug has 2nd relic, 
ClearObjectives()
Objective 5, "WHITE".

When both relics at base (GetDistance, Relic1/2, Nav3) < 200 then
ClearObjectives()
Wave 2 / Objective 6, "WHITE"
Spawn:
2 svhraz (spawn_attack1, spawn_attack2) //path_000D, path_000E
2 svrckt (spawn_attack3, spawn_attack4) (IMPROVEMENT: spawn 2nd one at path_0010/move earlier svfigh spawn to path_000A?) //path_000F, path_0010
Attack Recycler.

When all 4 attackers are dead, 
SucceedMission(GetTime()+5.0, "bdmisn27wn.des");

if Recycler is destroyed, 
FailMission(GetTime()+5.0, "bdmisn27l1.des");

if Tug destroyed, 
FailMission(GetTime()+5.0, "bdmisn27l2.des");
