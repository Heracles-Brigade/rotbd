We need to contact our base on the Moon to order them to start evacuating. The Soviets have a communications outpost on Titan that is jamming our transmissions. There are three Comm Towers, all of which will need to be disabled to be able to transmit to the Moon base.

Mission Objectives:
Destroy the outpost defences.
Disable all Soviet Comm Towers.
Rendezvous with Private Grigg at the Pickup Zone without engaging American forces.

Engineering Report:
There are several American Howitzer units on the mountain ridges. These will need to be taken out before the Comm Towers can be secured.
