Wave 1: Attention, Black Dogs, we have reason to believe that a top NSDF Scientist has been captured by the Soviets and taken to one of their outposts here on the Moon. In order to find out which outposts they are at, we need to intercept their communications. 

Cobra one, your tank has been fitted with a decoding device. When you are close enough to the communications tower, it will activate and tell us exactly where the scientist is being held.



Wave 2: The scientist has been relocated to the main Research facility. This facility is powered by Large solar arrays at nav point 2 and 3. Cripple the research facility by destroying these solar arrays.

Wave 3: We're reading power fluctuations in the research facility. Excellent work Black Dogs, now take out their remaining solar arrays.

Wave 4: Nice work, the power is down. Radar indicates some american reinforcements approaching. What the? the americans are using the same communication frequency as the russians! what did they just say? Black Dogs! The american units are heading to the research facility to evacuate the scientists. They're working hand in hand with the russians! Stop them!
