Wave 1: Cobra One, you'll be mostly defending in this mission. After our discovery of the soviet-american alliance, we must assume that we are on our own. To this end, we are constructing a new command base. Do not stray too far from this base.

Wave 2: We believe the soviets are building a base of their own. We must destroy the base before it becomes too great a threat.

Wave 3: The americans are assisting the soviets, and a major attack force is on the way. Destroy the attack force.
