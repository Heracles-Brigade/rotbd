Starting objects:

Player Recycler: recycler //label_0017
CCA Base Geyser: ccageyser //label_0022

Nav2: nav2 //label_0003
Nav3: nav3 //label_0004

On Start:

SetScrap(1, 10)
SetPilot(1, 5)
spawn 1 svrecy (spawn_svrecy) //path_0003
spawnn sbtowe(spawn_sbtowe1, spawn_sbtowe2) //path_0001, path_0002
Wave1/Objective 1, white. 
3 svfigh spawn (spawn_n1, spawn_n2, spawn_n3). Goto north_path. //path_0005, path_006, path_0007
SetObjectiveOn(Recycler);

Before objective 7:
if GetDistance(Player, Recycler) > 700, FailMission(GetTime()+5.0, "bdmisn22l1.des");
addhealth to svrecy, and both sbtowe. (IMPROVEMENT: To make truly invincible, save maxhealth, SetMaxHealth(h, 0), then after objective 7 SetMaxHealth back to saved value).

When recycler deploys, objective 1 green, objective 2 white.

When recycler deploys, after 120 seconds: 
spawn 2 svfigh (spawn_n1, spawn_n2), Goto north_path. //path_0005, path_0006, goto: path_0019

When 2nd scavenger is complete, Objective 2 green, objective 3 white.
spawn 2 svfigh, (spawn_w4, spawn_w5), goto west_path. //path_000C, path_000D goto path_0018

When scrap is >= 20, clear objectives, objective 4 white.

When factory is complete, objective 4 green, objective 5 white.
spawn 2 svfigh, (spawn_w4, spawn_w5), goto west_path. //path_000C, path_000D goto path_0018

When built 3 new tanks and 1 new bomber, objective 5 green, objective 6 white.
2 more svfigh(spawn_w4, spawn_w5), does nothing, never commanded by script. (Bug in original? Goto west_path) //path_000C, path_000D goto path_0018
2 sbspow(spawn_sbspow1, spawn_sbspow2) //path_000E, path_000F
2 svscav(spawn_w2, spawn_w3) //path_000A, path_000B

When 3 turrets built, objective 6 green. (NOTE: You can build 2-3 turrets before finishing offensive force, and they still count for this objective.)
spawn 2 svfigh(spawn_e1, spawn_e2). Goto east_path. //path_0010, path_0011 goto path_001A

45 seconds after 3 turrets built:
Wave 2 / Objective 7 "WHITE". 
SetObjectiveOn(svrecy), 
SetObjectiveOn(sbtowe1), 
SetObjectiveOn(sbtowe2)
svrecy, and sbtowes no longer addhealth.

When both GT's are destroyed:
SetObjectiveOff(svrecy).
spawn 2 svfigh(spawn_n4, spawn_n5), Goto north_path. //path_0008, path_0009, goto path_0019
spawn 3 avwalk(spawn_avwalk1, spawn_avwalk2, spawn_avwalk3), goto nsdf_path. //path_0013, path_0014, path_0015 goto path_001B
spawn 2 avtank(spawn_tank1, spawn_w1), goto(nsdf_path), (far tank: Goto west_path). //path_0016, path_0004 goto path_001B, path_0018
CameraPath "camera_nsdf" target: avwalk(@spawn_avwalk3) //path_0017, (walker @path_0015),
SetObjectiveOn all attackers. 
Wave 3, objecitve 8 white. 

??When all attackers are dead, nothing happens, mission objectives don't update. IMPROVEMENT: Re-direct to destroy svrecy/setobjectiveon svrecy again?

When enemy recy is dead, clear objectives, objective 9.

When comm tower is built, SucceedMission(GetTime()+5.0, "bdmisn22wn.des");

If your recycler is destroyed, FailMission(GetTime(), "bdmisn22l2.des");
