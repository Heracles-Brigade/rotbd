Intelligence has found what we believe to be the remains of a crashed Stymphalian bird on Venus - and even better, they believe the Soviets have yet to discover it. Securing the relic and recovering any information we can from it is now our top priority. There are CCA forces in the area, so try to keep from drawing attention to yourself. Commander Shaw will take charge of the base by orbital link. You will remain the senior field officer.

MISSION OBJECTIVES:
- Secure and investigate the relic

ENGINEERING REPORT:
Your tank has been outfitted with a scanning device that will allow you to gather information on the relic by getting close to it. You must remain near the relic for it to work.
