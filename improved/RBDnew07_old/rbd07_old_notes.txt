well, alright
the idea I have in my head is there'll be two enemy bases, one NSDF and one CCA, on opposite corners of the map from the BDog base
each relic will be in-between the BDogs and one of the enemy bases
the player should probably have a Factory but with limited build capacity
so only one Tug
the player has to try to claim both relics, there'll be enemy patrols, a few attacking forces, basic stuff
the fun part though will be when the NSDF and CCA send Tugs of their own after the relics
maybe, every 3-6 minutes, semi-randomly, one of the bases will spawn a Tug and a force to protect it
there'll be a short cinematic of the Tug leaving the base
an audio message of "The ___ are sending a Tug after the relic! Intercept them!"
and so the player will have to juggle between the two bases each trying to nab a relic
and then as for the fake distress signal and ambush
if we keep that element of the mission
I imagine there'll be an offshoot path from both relics
and whichever relic you go for first decides which path spawns the distress signal and ambush
and whether the ambush is NSDF or CCA
but there'll only be a single ambush attempt



--Objectives
Capture relic1
Capture relic2

--Events
after x time or relic1 is taken:
  send cca/nsdf tug + force to take relic2

after x time or relic2 is taken:
  send cca/nsdf tug + force to take relic1

any relic taken:
  cca/nsdf attacks tug
  first time: distress signal (fancy shit?)

after any relic has been "secured"
  send attack forces against base
  try to recapture relic

both relic captured:
  win

any/both relics lost:
  fail
